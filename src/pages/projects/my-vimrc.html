  <p class="flow-text">As an assignment for my Data Communications class I wrote a client/server
  program in Java. The major hurdles were figuring out where and how to catch
  errors without catastrophically crashing the program.
  </p>

  <p class="flow-text">I found the best strategy for catching exceptions is to catch them as close
  to the point where they occured. For example, in the Aloha File Server there
  is an AlohaSocket class that manages all of the connection setup and 
  message/response handling. The classes utilize AlohaSocket shouldn't need to 
  try/catch a bunch of errors which is what would happen if AlohaSocket just 
  throws errors to the caller instead of dealing with them.
