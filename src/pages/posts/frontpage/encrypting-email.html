If you are an Internet user and I'm guessing you are because you are reading 
this. Then there is one thing that you can do today to make the Internet a 
better place. Create an OpenPGP key and post it on a well known server like
<a href="https://pgp.mit.edu" target"_blank">pgp.mit.edu</a>.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
What is an OpenPGP key good for? First of all, you can use it to sign email messages.
How do you know that email with the strange link to a PHP file is really from
you're aunt Judy. I've had to call relatives and friends many times to tell them
that their email account had been compromised and was spamming their contacts
with links to malware. This one of the major ways that malware spreads. With 
OpenPGP keys come in pairs. A sender signs an email with the private key that 
only the sender knows. The other half of the key pair, the public key, is stored
on a public server. Anyone who receives a signed message can check the public 
server to make sure the senders identity is verified. Of course most modern 
email clients will allow you to automate the whole signing process.

<p class="flow-text">
But how do I know that the public key on the server is really from my aunt Judy
and not some attacker who just uploaded there own key to the server. The answer
is a Web of Trust. Take a look at the entry for my key below.

You'll see that my key is signed by me [selfsig] and my good friend Jason Favrod.
Jason signed my key because I gave him the key fingerprint while we were hanging
out together (in personam). He physically verified that my identity matched my
key fingerprint. The more people that sign a key using this method the more trustworthy
the signature. In the past we have relied on signatures and ID cards to authenticate
messages. Those methods don't scale well. In an age of global digital communication
we need to use stronger security. In order for the web of trust to grow more 
people to use OpenPGP.

I can only scratch the surface right now. PGP can be used to protect more than
just emails; it can encrypt and sign files and documents as well.
Below are some resources and tutorials. I can't stress enough the importance
of generating a revocation key and keeping it safe!
