  <h4 class="header grey-text text-darken-2">The Ultimate Password Management Setup</h4>

  I recently wrote about how I manage my passwords using a combination of Lastpass
  and pass. Since learning about pass I've come to rely on it more and more. Lastpass
  is good, but I really like to have more control on where my passwords are stored
  and I like a command line interface. In addition pass keeps the password store
  in a simple directory structure, everything is just files--the Unix way.

  A few days ago I put pass to the test while upgrading my new chromebook to Ubuntu
  15.04. I simply transfered the password store file over to the chromebook, imported and
  trusted my GPG keys and everything just worked now all of my passwords were on
  my shiny new chromebook. But now I needed to generate an SSH key for the chromebook.
  After using pass to generate a nice long 64 character password for my I realized
  that I now had two different password stores on two computers that were out of
  sync. I couldn't sleep at night. Should I just copy the updated file with the 
  new SSH key back to my other computer? No way, this is where Git comes to the rescue.

  <p class="flow-text">
  Pass comes with a nice interface to Git. All I had to do was</p>
  <pre>cd ~/.password-store && pass git init</pre>
  <p class="flow-text">
  Pass takes care of the first commit by adding all of your stored passwords to 
  the new repo. Then I went to my server and made a new bare repo. Even though 
  pass stores all of the passwords using GPG encryption I don't feel comfortable
  putting the password store someplace public like Github. I didn't name the 
  new repo <em>password-repo</em> for obvious reasons but I tried to name it something
  nobody would want to read.</p>
  <pre>git init --bare EULA.git</pre>
  <p class="flow-text">
  Now on my machine with the password repo I just added the remote origin and pushed.
  </p>
  <pre>git remote add origin me@example.com:EULA.git</pre> 
  <p class="flow-text">Now I'm all set to pull and push password changes and I can keep the 
  password stores in sync among many machines. There is even an option in pass 
  to sign every commit to the password store so you can be sure that you are 
  the only one editing the files.
