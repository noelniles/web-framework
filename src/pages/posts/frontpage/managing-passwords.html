I'll let you in on a secret. I don't know any of my passwords. At last count I 
have 54 unique password/username combination for various online accounts. On top
of that I have several passwords for servers and laptops and GPG keys. And I 
don't know any of them. Okay, I actually do know two of them, but even that is
a little too much for me. I'm lazy.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
For a year and a half now I've been using <a href="https://lastpass.com">
Lastpass</a> and I love it. It lets me generate super long unique random 
passwords for every site. Then I just have to remember one password for Lastpass
which takes care of filling in sensitive information for me. All of the passwords
are stored in an encrypted database so nobody can retrieve your passwords without
knowing your master password. Needless to say the master password should be long, 
memorable, and contain letters, numbers, and special characters. I hate when a
site restricts password length or usable characters.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
Lastpass works with Firefox and Android which is perfect for me. The premium
version for Android costs ~$12.00/year and it's worth every penny to me. But
I don't like to completely rely on an external service to store my important
credentials. So I also use a tool for Linux called <a href="http://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>. Pass will create a 
GnuPG encrypted directory structure and store your passwords safely. The file
can be backed up like an other file and you just have to remember the password
to your GPG key. Pass will even let you copy passwords to the clipboard and 
manage changes to passwords using git.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
There is a Ruby script <a href="http://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/importers/lastpass2pass.rb">
here</a> that allows you to import all of your passwords from Lastpass into 
your local encrypted pass directory. Now I have an encrypted directory that I 
backup locally and use if I don't have network access. I can sleep at night.
It's almost perfect. Look for some more later with details about how to set everything 
up almost perfectly.
